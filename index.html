        <h1>Hello, welcome to Matia Mathes Illustrations.<br> Making science education  accessible, appealing, and alive! </h1>
        <h2>... one illustration at a time. </h2>
        <p>Matia Mathes is a freelance artist that creates original art with a focus on scientific illustrations and animations. She is located in San Luis Obispo, California. The image she wishes to portray is one that makes scientific education accessible, appealing, and alive. Science is often hard to understand by the common person, so this brand hopes to simplify complex topics into visuals that anyone can learn from. In addition, visuals and illustrations can make seemingly boring topics really fun, engaging, and memorable. Lastly, animations bring certain topics and concepts to life through movement.</p>
